              <h2>What's Front End?</h2>
              <p><b>Front-end web development</b> is the <i>practice of converting data to a graphical interface</i>, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.</p>
              <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/web-development">
              Your website is the center of your digital eco-system, like a brick and mortar location, the experience matters once a customer enters, just as much as the perception they have of you before they walk through the door.
              </blockquote>
              <h3>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
              <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the <u>backbone</u> of any website development process, without which a web page doesn't exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.</p>

              <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
              <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.</p>
              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface.</p>
